The lambda function checks if the value contains a plus sign ('+'). If it does, it replaces the dollar sign with a space using the replace() method, converting the value to a string. If the value does not contain a plus sign, it leaves it as it is. Finally, the modified or unchanged value is assigned back to the 'Price' column.\n",
        "This line further modifies the 'Install' column of the 'Playstore' DataFrame. It uses another lambda function to convert each value in the 'Install' column to a floating-point number. It achieves this by calling the float() function on each value. The modified values are assigned back to the 'Installs' column. We have successfully converted the datatype of values in the Installs column from string to float."

Higher the number of installs, higher is the user base, and higher are the total number of reviews dropped by the users. ThePriceis slightly negatively correlated with the Rating, Reviews, and Installs. This means that as the prices of the app increases, the average rating, total number of reviews and Installs fall slightly. TheRating is slightly positively correlated with theInstalls and Reviews column. This indicates that as the the average user rating increases, the app installs and number of reviews also increase."
